Car Dataset Decision Tree Model

Overview
This repository contains a decision tree model built on a dataset related to cars. The predictive model is designed to classify or predict the class of cars based on various features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the implementation involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Label Encoding, and Standard Scaling as preprocessing steps to enhance the model's performance.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of two parts: a training set and a testing set. Both sets have columns such as buying, maintenance, number of doors, number of persons, luggage boot size, safety rating, and the class of the car. The target variable is the "class" column, which represents the category/class of the car.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA has been performed on the training set to gain insights and a better understanding of the data. Visualizations and statistical analyses have been used to explore relationships between variables, identify outliers, and handle missing data appropriately. EDA helps in making informed decisions about feature engineering and preprocessing.

Preprocessing Steps:

Label Encoding
Categorical variables in both the training and testing sets have been encoded using Label Encoding. This transformation converts categorical data into a numerical format, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms like decision trees.

Standard Scaling
To ensure that all numerical features have a similar scale, Standard Scaling has been applied to both the training and testing sets. This preprocessing step helps in preventing features with larger scales from dominating the learning process and ensures that the decision tree model is not biased towards a particular feature.

Decision Tree Model
A decision tree model has been implemented using the scikit-learn library. Decision trees are powerful tools for classification tasks and provide a clear, interpretable structure. The model has been trained on the preprocessed training set, and its performance has been evaluated using the testing set.


Results:

The results of the decision tree model, including accuracy and other relevant metrics, can be found in the notebook or script output. Interpretation of the decision tree structure is provided to understand how the model is making predictions.
